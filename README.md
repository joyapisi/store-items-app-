# 📖 [Ruby_Capstone] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[Ruby_Capstone]** Ruby_Capstone is a project that keeps a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums, movies, and games. 
By building this application, you will learn how to implement OOP properties which are Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism using Ruby. This project also follows <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">Gitflow.</a>

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Creating your first "School Library" project

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

-A Git hub account
-Git bash
-IRB
-Visual Studio Code as your code editor

# Setup <a name="set-up"></a>

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone[(https://github.com/joyapisi/my-ruby-capstone.git)]
```
## Understand Set Up Requirements
Since this code is using webpack, you will run `npm start` in your terminal to run it instead of using the live server. 

## Understand Set Up Requirements

### Define Ruby

<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYm0kfnRTJk">Ruby in 100 seconds</a>

### Define Linters

A linter is a tool to help you improve your code. You can learn more about Linters here: (source: (<https://www.testim.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-heres-a-definition-and-quick-start-guide/>)).

#### Advantages of Linting:

1. Fewer errors in production- The use of linters helps to diagnose and fix technical issues such as code smells. As a result, fewer defects make their way to production.
2. Achieving a more readable and consistent style, through the enforcement of its rules.
3. Having more secure and performant code.
4. Having an objective and measurable assessment of code quality.
5. Having fewer discussions about code style and aesthetic choices during code reviews.

# Install Ruby and Linters <a name="install"></a>

## Install Ruby <a name="ruby-installation"></a>

- Follow the instructions <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10">here</a> to set up ruby JS.

## Install Linters <a name="linter-installation"></a>

Linters for various programming languages are available for use, e.g. Rubocop for Ruby or ESLint for JavaScript.

There are many ways you can integrate a linter in your workflow:

-text editor plugin
-GitHub Actions
-GitHub apps

### Step to Install Ruby Linters


1. Run

```
bundle install
```  
To check linter errors, run

```
rubocop
``` 

### [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) <a name="stylelint-installation"></a>

A mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

1. Run

`npm install --save-dev stylelint@13.x stylelint-scss@3.x stylelint-config-standard@21.x stylelint-csstree-validator@1.x`

2. Copy [.stylelintrc.json](./.stylelintrc.json) to the root directory of your project.

3. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**

If you think that change is necessary - open a Pull Request in this repository and let your code reviewer know about it. 4. Run `npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"` on the root of your directory of your project.

5. Fix linter errors.

6. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** feel free to research auto-correct options for Stylelint if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!
